Bluesteel Look and feel package, features a metal look with blue buttons. Highly visual efects like fade in, or collapsable system menu are achieved thanks to the swingx library.
The look and feel packages need to contain a {@link InitInterface} class named Init, a FormLAF and 
a class LAF per each {@link FormControl} in the {@link org.universAAL.ui.handler.gui.swing.model.FormControl}
package.
